This poster showed the unique prediction of visual attention span of Chinese 10-to 12-year-old children's spelling. Results indicated that after controlling for nonverbal ability, phonological awareness, rapid automatised naming, and character identification skills, visual attention span still significantly predicted the spelling performance.
